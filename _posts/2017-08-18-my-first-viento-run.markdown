# First downwind run in Hood River

I was luckily able to swing a last minute trip to Hood River, Oregon for the [Naish Columbia Gorge Paddle Challenge](http://gorgepaddlechallenge.com/gpc1/). I got there a day early and did a practice run - my first time down the famous Viento Run. It's a 7-8 mile downwind stand-up-paddleboard run from Viento State Park, west of Hood River, right into town, to the Hood River waterfront park. And boy, was it fun!

[Many](http://distressedmullet.com/2017/08/15/guide-to-the-naish-gorge-paddle-challenge/?utm_content=buffer30a83&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer) [great](https://paddlesociety.com/viento-downwinder-ultimate-safety-logistics-guide/) [articles](https://standuppaddletheworld.com/2016/01/28/561/) have already been written about how to do the run, so I'm not going to repeat that info here, except for the perspective and my impressions on doing the run the first time. 

Firstly, *Don't do it alone.* It's enough of a head trip when you get started, and the consequences of unexpected equipment failure, or other accident, are great enough. It's much safer to have someone out there who's watching you, and you watching out for them.


It's really a personal challenge


You'l fall in a lot on your first run, most likely. So two things, clothing, and PDF choice. (I'm assuming a leash is a given)
Lifejacket - I chose a full PFD for my first run. Yes, some people say it's a bit harder to climb back on the board if you fall, but not for me. I think you just need to pick out the right PFD that doesn't get in the way. I like my NRS Ninja. I use this one whitewater SUP too with the NRS Knife.
