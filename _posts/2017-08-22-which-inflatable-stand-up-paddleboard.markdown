# Which Inflatable Paddleboard Should You Buy?

Everyone I talk to about getting into SUP seems to asking about inflatable paddleboards.

First they ask me if they are good. Yes, I think for your first board it can be a great way to go. Why? Because it gives you the flexibility to try out lots
of different environments.

## Advantages:

- Storage space
- Travel
- Durability
- Whitewater

## Disadvantages:

- Speed
- Racing
- Surfing


## Some good brands:

### Starboard

### Red Paddle Company

I have the Explorer 13'2". It's a great board, especially for bigger paddlers. Stable in all kinds of conditions. It has a long waterline and can go the distance. 

### Hala

### SIC
