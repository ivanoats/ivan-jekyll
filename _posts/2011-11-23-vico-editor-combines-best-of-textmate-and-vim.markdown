**Update:** Vico didn't amount to much but it was a cool idea. If you are using Sublime Text now, check out the [Vintageous](https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous) plugin.

I'm in love with a new text editor. It's called [Vico](http://vicoapp.com). For Vim fans, you have all your comon keybindings for blazingly fast editing. For TextMate fans, you've got all your bundles and snippets. It really is the best of both worlds. 

Here's a screen shot showing a vertical split between the view and the view spec, with RSpec results  in a Rails app:

There is a link on [Vico's](http://vicoapp.com) site for a free trial app - go try it!
