**Congrats!** You have received a coding challenge from a potential employer. Or, you have a comittment-free rainy weekend to hack on a new, green-field coding project.

**What's the best way to get started?** *Don't get stuck with a long, boring setup.* Even copying and pasting some old code could work... but how about getting everything ready in a couple of commands?

`git clone ivanoats/modular-boilerplate`
and then:
`cd modular-boilerplate && npm install && bower install`

This repository includes a **boilerplate for full-stack web apps** using CommonJS ([Browserify](http://browserify.org)) modules, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), a simple, extensible, [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com) sever, and the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) Testing Framework with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) runner. 

Basically, it has **everything you need to get going** to create modular, testable JavaScript code on the server and the browser.

Open up `app/js/app.js` in your favorite editor and start writing some code!

If anyone is interested in me turning this into a [Yeoman generator](http://yeoman.io/authoring/), please let me know.
