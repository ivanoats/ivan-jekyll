Setting up secure websites has been a complex process. It involves arcane commands typed into a terminal screen. [Aerobatic](https://www.aerobatic.com), an Internet startup, devised a way to provision and deploy certificates via a few clicks. All websites must encrypt customer data with an SSL certificate. The green padlock in a browser's address bar is an important trust signal to show site visitors.

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / Transport Security Layer (TLS) certificates enable secure communication. The certificates usually cost $50 to $500 each year. Amazon Web Services (AWS) recently released the AWS certificate manager which enables free certificates. Aerobatic has simplified the process so that novice web developers can make sites secure. Experienced developers will appreciate more advanced features such as wildcards and auto-renewal features. 

Many developers have let a certificate expire, bringing down their application for users. The auto renewal feature will ensure that does not happen. Wildcard certificates allow site owners to protect many different sub-domains without tedious extra configuration.
 
[David Von Lehman](https://twitter.com/davidvlsea) founded Aerobatic to help simplify a developer's daily experience. Enterprise developers in the past have had to wait for IT to provision a server. Independent or small business web developers have had to learn how to manage web servers. Neither task is a core competency of a web developer. Aerobatic simplifies complex deployment tasks and brings them within reach of web developers.

The Aerobatic hosting platform removes barriers to getting a site online.
