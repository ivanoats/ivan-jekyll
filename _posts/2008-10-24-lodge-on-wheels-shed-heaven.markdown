<p><img src="http://squob.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/lodge_on_wheels_1.jpg" />This is a cool, beyond-retro camper. It's really a log cabin on wheels. It has some green touches, like no VOC wood and more wood than plastic. If you could really downsize and live in it, I guess you would reduce your footprint. But look at the monster pickup truck required to tow it. That's a gas guzzler for sure. I wonder if they would put solar panels on top? Still, it looks like the kind of thing I would consider if I was going to head out to the woods and make a life there. And, you have to check out the inside, beautiful. It's like living in a sauna, which I love.</p>
