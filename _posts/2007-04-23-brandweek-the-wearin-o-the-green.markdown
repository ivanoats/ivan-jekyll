<p>Another quote, this time in a <a href="http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/spotlight/article_display.j%0Asp?vnu_content_id=1003574857">BrandWeek article</a> on Green marketing of organics and clothing:</p>
<blockquote>As Ivan Storck, owner of SustainableMarketing.com, put it, there is a triple bottom line: people, planet, and profit, and the people part of the equation must come first. "Sustainability means more than being eco-friendly," he said. "Sustainability also means you're in it for the long haul."
</blockquote>
<p>Congrats also to <a href="http://www.research-sight.com/">Jerry Savage</a>, and his new company <a href="http://www.research-sight.com/">Research-Sight</a> - lots of great quotes from him in there. Thanks to Sandra O'Loughlin for interviewing us. </p>
