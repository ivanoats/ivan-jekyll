I frequently get asked how the UW certificate differs from Code Fellows' Ruby on Rails bootcamp. I am in a fairly good place to compare them because I teach in both programs. Each one has its own strengths:

## [UW Certificate](http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/ruby-programming.html)

* 30 weeks total
* 3 hours per week with 9 hours of expected homework
* Intro to Ruby Course ( 10 out of the 30 weeks )
* Classes meet at night 6-9pm
* Accredited Institution

## [Code Fellows Rails Bootcamp](http://www,codefellows.org/rails)

* 8 weeks total
* 3 hours per day class time 
* 3 hours per day lab time
* A couple more hours of homework at night/weekend
* Guest lectures on career building, interviewing practice, resume workshop
* More computer science fundamentals
* More javascript
* Job guarantee

As far as Rails content, because both Rails and Advanced Rails are taught by the same team of Brook and me, the two options are very similar.

As a teacher, there are advantages to doing both together. I meet more working professionals in my UW courses because of the night time slot. I like the support of the Professional and Continuing Education department. My Code Fellows classes offer me a more rapid feedback cycle and allow me to improve my teaching continuously, and it's exciting to be part of a startup that aims to change education.
