This post was originally a [Slide Deck](http://ivanoats.github.io/how_i_stay_up_to_date_on_js/), which you can still view.

Part of what we teach students in [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org) development accelerators is how to keep up with changes and news in the stack that they've chosen to study. Here are the sources that I give my students to stay up to speed on all things JavaScript:
