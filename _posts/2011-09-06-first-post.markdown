I'll be blogging here about programming Ruby (and Rails), fixing PHP, and Mac OS X and Ubuntu sysadmin.

One of the first things I'm doing is fixing the [express licensing site](/http://depts.washington.edu/uwc4c/express-licenses/) to accept payments via PayPal instead of FolioDirect.

I also have set up a micro cloud with an Ubuntu VM running
[CloudFoundry](http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/08/howto-install-cloudfoundry-server-paas.html).
This box will be used for testing various Ruby on Rails apps. It's our own private [PaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service).

In addition, I am helping the Center for Training set up a test server to prototype a Ruby on Rails based Learning Management System (LMS) called [Canvas](http://www.instructure.com/).
