Iâ€™m Ivan Storck, a Senior Software Engineer at [lululemon](https://shop.lululemon.com), specializing in scalable, high-performance web applications for the companyâ€™s content management and upper funnel e-commerce platform.

My expertise spans front-end and back-end development, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like JavaScript, ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, and AWS. As part of the Content Management and Design Systems teams, I focus on building reusable, accessible, and scalable components that drive consistency, observability, and operational effectiveness across digital experiences. Previously, I contributed to Personalization and Membership initiatives, enhancing both customer engagement and business efficiency.

With over 25 years of experience in software engineering, UX, and entrepreneurship, I integrate performance optimization, capability maturity (CMM), operational effectivess, and observability into my approach. As a Certified Usability Analyst, I am committed to blending technical excellence with intuitive, user-centric design that meets both business and customer needs.

Beyond tech, I have a deep passion for geospatial analysis, aerial photography, and mapping technologies. My work includes drone mapping, 3D GIS imagery, OpenStreetMap data extraction, and serverless web development, bridging the gap between data visualization and environmental exploration.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m driven by adventure and lifelong learning:

- Entrepreneurship â€“ Founded and led web hosting and training companies, focusing on sustainable and scalable digital solutions.
- Technical Education â€“ Former instructor at Code Fellows and the University of Washington, mentoring the next generation of developers.
- Sailing & Outdoor Exploration â€“ Combining my love for stand-up paddle racing, drone photography, and geospatial analysis to explore and document the Salish Sea and beyond.
- AI & Innovation â€“ Exploring AIâ€™s role in creative fields, from data visualization to digital music synthesis.
- PSUPA Certified Stand-up Paddleboard Instructor â€“ Sharing my passion for water sports and performance coaching.

When Iâ€™m not coding, mapping, or teaching, you can find me racing SUPs, sailing, or planning my next adventure on the water.
